# jzip
Jacob's zip software

Currently not working and only tested on linux :(

## Usage
```
jzip <file>
```

## Support
- Linux
- Probably macOS (not tested)
- Never Windows, if they ever want to support POSIX, then maybe, should work on WSL though

## Directory Structure
```
src    - The source files used
head   - The header files used
working- The directory where the executable should be tested
```

## TODO
- [ ] Chunked format
- [ ] Parallel decompression
- [ ] Move from test software to actual software
- [ ] Archiving for multiple files
- [ ] Archiving for directories
- [ ] POSIX permissions support (777, 755, etc.)
